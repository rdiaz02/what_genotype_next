- 3Dplots_js_all_data_sets.R generates left panel (3A) and produces
  data_for_m.txt, colors_for_m.txt and focal_genots.txt

- scatterplot_3D.m generates, in Matlab, the 3D plot (3B) using files
  data_for_m.txt and colors_for_m.txt

- the file focal_genots.txt contains the list of genotypes for which
  accurate consecutive prediction may be possible (as described in
  section 3.7 of the Suppl Mat)
